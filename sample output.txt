Welcome to CPU scheduling simulator of single and multi core architectures. 
 --------------- 
To start, choose if you want to test the algorithms against a list of tasks or  from a file or tasks that are randomly generated. This program comes with three  example test files: test1.txt, test2.txt, test3.txt. 
Readme includes details on how to  create your own testing text files for this simulation.
